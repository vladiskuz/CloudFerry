    """Migration strategy used with NetApp multi backend.

    Extends `cinder_database` functionality with defining which volumes
    are stored on each particular NetApp server.

    NOTE: This is very (very!!!) custom implementation of Cinder storage with
    NFS NetApp backend. The reason to provide it was in different configuration
    of NetApp backend for Cinder on SRC and DST clouds in one case of
    migrations. It concerns 'host' attribute of volume. In SRC it looks like
    <host_name>, but in DST it should be as <host_name>@<NetApp_server_id>. And
    because of copying Cinder database data, standard NFS migration strategy
    (cloudferrylib.os.storage.cinder_database.CinderStorage) would not work in
    this particular case.

    To use this strategy - specify cinder_migration_strategy in config as
    'cloudferrylib.os.storage.cinder_netapp.CinderNetApp'.
